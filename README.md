# COGS 119 - Individual Project Contribution
This repository archives my (Edwin Ruiz) individual contributions to the COGS 119 Project. Each submission is presented in its original format, preserving the exact state of my work at the time. Any similarities or additional elements incorporated into subsequent collaborative work can be traced back to these original submissions, except for Data Analysis "Massive Memory Analysis.ipynb".


**My Role (Edwin Ruiz):**

Throughout the COGS 119 Project, I actively took initiative to keep the project moving forward. Similar to Charles Darwin, who is known for his groundbreaking research, I consistently initiated meetings and ensured assignments progressed by contributing to all aspects of the project. 

## Contributions Breakdown:

* **Project Work: Introduction (Individual Submission):** Although this was an individual assignment, I wrote the introduction and shared it with the team with the intention of receiving their input and improvements. While I'm unsure what they submitted, I haven't received any contributions to this specific document.

* **Project Work: Experiment Draft (Group Submission):** We began by forking the provided project repository and created our own branch. My individual work can be found on the "Edwin" branch within the forked repository [link: [https://github.com/darwinzyyu/cogs119_testrepo/tree/edwin-trials/Experiment_Draft](https://github.com/darwinzyyu/cogs119_testrepo/tree/edwin-trials/Experiment_Draft)]. Similar to the introduction, I shared this draft with the team for potential contributions, but I don't believe any changes were made.
  
* **Project Work: Methods Preregistration (Group Submission):** Again, I took the initiative to complete this assignment and shared it with the group for potential feedback. However, I left the "Data Analysis" section blank as we hadn't discussed or reached a consensus on how we would approach the analysis. It's possible that other team members filled in this section before final submission.

* **Project Work - Final Experiment (Group Submission):**  contributions I completed after receiving feedback (as reported on Google doc "Meeting Notes for Massive_Memory" Page 4 [link: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uynRFmnUuxCl4y4xWxjCsanNQOw6epT-ksTw0ePSl1Q/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uynRFmnUuxCl4y4xWxjCsanNQOw6epT-ksTw0ePSl1Q/edit?usp=sharing)]
  - added Preload Images
  - removed feedback during test 
  - removed repeated incorrect trials 
  - completed memory trial list and test trial list to 50 images per condition (NOVEL, EXEMPLAR, STATE) 150 images total, 
  - added counterbalance logic to code and json file [ https://gist.github.com/NeuraByte-UCSD-ITS/6a5ebaee57d49d0235ba938b518d7242 ] 
  - added store trial_phase information for test trials
  - added confidence rating per image selection 
  - added final debrief message, 
  - added Participant survey feedback,
  - removed final data display ("jsPsych.data.displayData()")
  - included instructors code that adds participant ID entry field and fixation duration to 800ms
  
* **Project Work: Data Analysis "Massive Memory Analysis.ipynb"**:  While reviewing the final version of this notebook [link: [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1s425jSClt8KF6oqUVIwIXOTAugl11Fbf?usp=sharing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1s425jSClt8KF6oqUVIwIXOTAugl11Fbf?usp=sharing)], I noticed updates to the "Section 3. Plot" made sometime between Sunday (12/8) and today, Monday (likely by Darwin). My understanding is that Darwin completed the analysis up to the middle of Section 3, while I finished the remaining sections.

  
* **Project Work: Final Project Report (Individual Submission):** I completed my final report, but this time, I only shared it directly with Darwin. I requested him to distribute it to anyone he felt contributed significantly to the project. Based on my involvement, I believe the main contributors were Darwin and myself.
